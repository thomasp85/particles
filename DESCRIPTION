Description: Simulating particle movement in 2D space has many application. The
    'particles' package implements a particle simulator based on the ideas 
    behind the 'd3-force' 'JavaScript' library. 'particles' implements all 
    forces defined in 'd3-force' as well as others such as vector fields, traps,
