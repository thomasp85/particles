\if{html}{\figure{logo.png}{options: style='float: right' alt='logo' width='120'}}

Simulating particle movement in 2D space has many application. The 'particles' package implements a particle simulator based on the ideas behind the 'd3-force' 'JavaScript' library. 'particles' implements all forces defined in 'd3-force' as well as others such as vector fields, traps, and attractors.
